Loan Status Prediction - Machine Learning Project
Project Overview:
This project aims to predict the loan approval status of applicants based on various demographic and financial features using machine learning techniques. The dataset includes variables such as applicant income, education level, employment status, credit history, and more. The objective is to build a model that accurately predicts whether a loan will be approved (Loan_Status).

Dataset Features:
Loan_ID: Unique identifier for each loan application.
Gender: Gender of the applicant.
Married: Marital status.
Dependents: Number of dependents.
Education: Education level (Graduate/Not Graduate).
Self_Employed: Self-employment status (Yes/No).
ApplicantIncome: Income of the applicant.
CoapplicantIncome: Income of the co-applicant (if any).
LoanAmount: Loan amount in thousands.
Loan_Amount_Term: Loan repayment term in months.
Credit_History: Whether the applicant meets credit history guidelines.
Property_Area: Urban, Semi-Urban, or Rural property location.
Loan_Status: Target variable (Y/N) indicating loan approval.
Key Steps:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualized the distribution of key features and analyzed relationships between features and the target variable.
Dealt with missing values, skewness, and outliers to ensure data quality.
Data Preprocessing:

Categorical variables were label-encoded.
Log transformation was applied to skewed numerical variables like income and loan amounts.
Model Building:

Split the data into training and testing sets.
Trained a classification model to predict loan approval status.
Evaluated the model's performance using a confusion matrix and calculated metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Results:
The model successfully predicted loan approval with reasonable accuracy, providing insights into which features are most important in determining loan approval.

Technologies Used:
Python: Data analysis and model building.
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn.
Conclusion:
This project demonstrates the use of machine learning to solve a real-world classification problem, with potential applications in finance and banking.
